# Finding the Mother Tree — Field Guide

A companion field guide inspired by Suzanne Simard's Finding the Mother Tree (2018).

This repository contains a practical, illustrated field guide designed to help naturalists, students, and artists explore the tree–fungus networks and stand dynamics discussed in the book. It pairs concise species sketches and notes with schematic illustrations to support on-site observation, note-taking, and sketching.

What this project is

- A companion, not a replacement: paraphrases and short citations are used to summarize themes from Finding the Mother Tree while avoiding extended copyrighted text. The guide focuses on observation, illustration, and simple ecological notes you can take in the field.
- Practical pages: each species page contains quick ID, ecology notes, printable sketches, a root/mycorrhiza schematic, field note prompts, and sketching cues.
- Visual assets: SVG illustrations and schematic plates intended as references and templates for watercolor/ink plates.

Repository structure

- `species/` — individual species markdown pages (one per species) and `template.md` for new pages
- `assets/images/` — SVGs and images used by species pages and plates
- `LICENSE` — repository license

How to use

- Open a species file in a Markdown viewer or editor to read the guide and print a page for the field.
- Use the SVGs in `assets/images/` as compositional templates for herbal-plate style illustrations or to trace layout for field sketches.
- Fill in the `Field notes` section on a tablet or printed page while you observe a tree.

Contributing

- To add a species, copy `species/template.md` to a new file and follow its structure. Add any new images to `assets/images/`.
- Keep pages concise and focused on field observation and illustration. Paraphrase sources and provide short quotations (≤90 characters) only when clearly cited.
- Open a pull request with your new species page and any new assets.

Attribution
