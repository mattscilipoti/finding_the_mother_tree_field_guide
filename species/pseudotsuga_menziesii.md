# Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)

Common name: Douglas-fir
Scientific name: Pseudotsuga menziesii
Date / Location: 
Observer: 

## Quick ID
- Habit: Tall, conical evergreen; stiff horizontal branches
- Needles: Single, flattened, soft, 2-ranked; blunt tip
- Bark: Thick, deeply furrowed on older trees; smoother on young
- Cones: Pendulous with distinctive three-pointed bracts

## Ecology
- Mycorrhizal type: Ectomycorrhizal (forms mantles and Hartig net)
- Typical associations: Dominant in mixed-conifer forests; networks with other ectomycorrhizal trees
- Soil / site: Well-drained upland soils; variable elevation

- 1 — Cone detail (bracts visible)
- 2 — Needles, shown as two-ranked
- 3 — Trunk bark (furrowed on older trees)

## Sketching cues
- Show scale bar (1 m and 10 cm)
- Draw needles in two ranks along twig; indicate cone bracts in close-up
- On root sketch, draw thick coarse roots and a mantle of fungal hyphae with fine branching lines for extraradical hyphae

## Book notes (paraphrase)
Paraphrase of material in Suzanne Simard's Finding the Mother Tree: Mature Douglas‑fir are described as keystone canopy trees that participate in extensive ectomycorrhizal networks. Simard discusses experiments showing carbon transfer between established trees and seedlings through fungal connections, and highlights how mother trees can support regeneration, especially of related seedlings. The narrative also emphasizes management implications: preserving networked mothers aids forest resilience.
