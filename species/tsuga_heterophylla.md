## Book notes (paraphrase)
Paraphrase of material in Finding the Mother Tree: Western hemlock appears in Simard's account as a common shade‑tolerant component of mixed forests that participates in ectomycorrhizal networks. The book describes how understory species and shade‑tolerant trees both benefit from fungal connections that mediate nutrient and carbon flows, affecting seedling survival and community dynamics.
